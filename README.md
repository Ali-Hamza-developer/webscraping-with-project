# 📊 Web Scraping & Data Projects  

This repository contains a collection of **Python mini-projects** focused on data extraction, analysis, and visualization. It was developed as part of the *"Python Project for Data Science"* course offered by IBM on Coursera.  

Each project demonstrates practical skills in **web scraping, data analysis with pandas, financial data using yfinance, and a final case study**.

## 📁 Contents include 

1. **Web Scraping**  
   - Extracted structured data from websites using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.  
   - Focused on parsing HTML tables and cleaning the data for analysis.  

2. **Data Analysis with Pandas**  
   - Performed data manipulation, cleaning, and transformations with `pandas`.  
   - Explored datasets and generated meaningful insights using aggregation and filtering.  

3. **Stock Analysis with YFinance**  
   - Used the `yfinance` library to fetch stock data.  
   - Visualized price trends and basic statistics of selected companies.  

4. **Final Project: AMD Stock & Revenue Analysis**  
   - Combined **yfinance + web scraping** to analyze **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)**.  
   - Scraped quarterly revenue data from financial sites.  
   - Compared revenue trends against historical stock prices using `matplotlib`.  
   - Showcased a **real-world data science workflow**: extraction → cleaning → visualization.
